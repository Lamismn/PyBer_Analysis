# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This Analysis uses data from a python based ride sharing application database to create some visual charts, using Jupyter notebook, Pandas libraries & Matplotlib, to show the relations between number of drivers, city types, & fares.
### Background
The analysis uses two csv files from the ride sharing application, showing the city data (city type, number of drivers) & the ride data (fare, and date & time). The files are available on the following link:

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help the application team understand trends and relations to be able to improve access to ride sharing services & determine affordability in under-served neighborhoods, to do this, we study the following:

1. The relation between the average Fare, the total number of rides per city & the total number of drivers
2. The measures of central tendencies for each city type
3. The ride count data & the percentages of total fares, total number of drivers, & total number of rides for each city type
4. Create a summary dataframe showing the Total Rides,	Total Drivers,	Total Fares	Average, Fare per Ride	Average, & Fare per Driver for each city type
5. Separate & analyze the data from a specific time frame of interest & show the relation between teh total fare & the date for each city type
